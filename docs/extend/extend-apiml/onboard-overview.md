# Onboarding Overview

As a developer, learn how to onboard the [sample service](#Sample-REST-API-Service) into Zowe. Depending on the programming language or framework, use the following detailed guides for onboarding. By the end of the guide you should be able to:

- have the [sample service](#Sample-REST-API-Service) onboarded in Zowe.
- select and apply appropriate onboarding method for your service.

## Prerequisites

Meet the following prerequisites before you onboard your service:

- Running instance of Zowe
 
  Log in to API Catalog to verify if the service is onboarded successfully.
  
  **Note**: For [static onboarding](onboard-static-definition.md), access to Zowe runtime is required, so the static service definition can be created.
  
- Certificate that is trusted by Zowe

  Zowe uses secured communication over TLSv1.2, thus the protocol version and the certificate is required. For more information, see [API Mediation Layer security setup](api-mediation-security.md#certificate-management-in-zowe-api-mediation-layer).

- Rest API-enabled service that you want to onboard

  Any Rest API-enabled service or the [sample service](#Sample-REST-API-Service).
  
  Your service should be documented in a valid `OpenApi 2.0/3.0` Swagger JSON format, and will be displayed in API Catalog.

- Access to Zowe artifactory

    ```
    Repository URL: https://zowe.jfrog.io/zowe/libs-release
    ```

- Gradle or Maven build system
  
## Service Onboarding Guides

Services can be updated to support the API Mediation Layer natively by updating the service code. Use the following guides to onboard your REST service to the Zowe API Mediation Layer:

### Recommended for services using Java

- [Onboard a REST API service with the Plain Java Enabler (PJE)](onboard-plain-java-enabler.md)
- [Onboard a Spring Boot based REST API Service](onboard-spring-boot-enabler.md)

### Other options

Use the following options if your service is not created in Java, or you do not want to change your codebase or use the libraries above:

- [Onboard a REST API using static definition without code changes](onboard-static-definition.md)
- [Onboard a REST API directly calling Zowe Discovery Service](onboard-direct-eureka-call.md)

### Legacy enablers

For legacy enabler documentation (version 1.2 and lower), refer to the previous version of the documentation:

- [Zowe Docs version 1.8.x](https://docs.zowe.org/v1-8-x/extend/extend-apiml/api-mediation-onboard-overview)

**Note**: Enablers up to the version 1.2 are no longer supported.

**Tip**: Use the enabler version 1.3 or higher to onboard your REST API service to the Zowe&trade; API Medaition Layer.

## Validate successful onboarding 

Validating your service registration can be done in the API ML Discovery Service or the API ML Catalog. If your service appears in the Discovery Service UI but is not visible in the API Catalog, wait for 2 minutes, then ensure that your configuration settings are correct.

**Notes**:

 - Specific addresses and user credentials for individual API ML components depend on your target runtime environment.

 - If you work with local installation of API ML and you use our dummy identity provider, enter `user` for both `username` and `password`. If API ML was installed by system administrators, ask them to provide you with actual addresses of API ML components and the respective user credentials.

- API Catalog may take a few minutes to display your registered service.

### Verify service discovery through Api Catalog:

  1. Ensure that your API service is displayed in the API Catalog UI, and that all information including API documentation is correct.

  2. Ensure that you can access your API service endpoints through the Gateway.

### Verify service discovery through Discovery Service:

 1. Issue HTTP GET request to the Discovery Service endpoint `/eureka/apps` to get service instance information:

    ```
    https://{zowe-hostname}:{discovery-service-port}/eureka/apps/{serviceId}
    ```

**Note**: The endpoint is protected by client certificate verification. A valid trusted certificate must be provided with the HTTP GET request.

 2. Check your service metadata.

    **Response example:**

    ```xml
    <application>
        <name>{serviceId}</name>
        <instanceId>{hostname}:{serviceId}:{port}</instanceId>
        <hostName>{hostname}</hostName>
        <app>{serviceId}</app>
        <ipAddr>{ipAddress}</ipAddr>
        <status>UP</status>
        <port enabled="false">{port}</port>
        <securePort enabled="true">{port}</securePort>
        <vipAddress>{serviceId}</vipAddress>
        <secureVipAddress>{serviceId}</secureVipAddress>

## Sample REST API Service

To demonstrate the concepts that apply to REST API services, we use an  [example of a Spring Boot REST API service](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-samples/tree/master/java/java-spring-boot). This example is used in the REST API onboarding guide [REST APIs without code changes required](onboard-static-definition.md) (static onboarding).  

You can build this service using instructions in the source code of the [Spring Boot REST API service example](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-samples/blob/master/java/java-spring-boot/README.md).

The Sample REST API Service has a base URL. When you start this service on your computer, the _service base URL_ is: `http://localhost:8080`. 

**Note:** If a service is deployed to a web application server, the base URL of the service (application) has the following format: `https://application-server-hostname:port/application-name`.

This sample service provides one API that has the base path `/v2`, which is represented in the base URL of the API as `http://localhost:8080/v2`. In this base URL, `/v2` is a qualifier of the base path that was chosen by the developer of this API. Each API has a base path depending on the particular implementation of the service. 

This sample API has only one single endpoint:

- `/pets/{id}` - *Find pet by ID*. 

This endpoint in the sample service returns information about a pet when the `{id}` is between 0 and 10. If `{id}` is greater than 0 or a non-integer, an error is returned. These are conditions set in the sample service.

**Tip:** Access http://localhost:8080/v2/pets/1 to see what this REST API endpoint does. You should get the following response:

```json
{
    "category": {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Cats"
    },
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Cat 1",
    "photoUrls": [
        "url1",
        "url2"
    ],
    "status": "available",
    "tags": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "tag1"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "tag2"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Note:** The onboarding guides demonstrate how to add the Sample REST API Service to the API Mediation Layer to make the service available through the `petstore` service ID.

The following diagram shows the relations between the Sample REST API Service and its corresponding API, REST API endpoint, and API Gateway:

![Sample REST API Components](../../user-guide/api-mediation/diagrams/rest-api-components-sample.svg)

This sample service provides a Swagger document in JSON format at the following URL:

 ```
 http://localhost:8080/v2/swagger.json
 ```

The Swagger document is used by the API Catalog to display API documentation.
